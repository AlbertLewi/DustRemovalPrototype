# DustRemovalPrototype
This program is a prototype for a dust removal pipeline I am working on for a project. The given pipeline uses a variety of OpenCV2 based methods and has many limitations to explore and fix. Arduino integration for lux detection can be used but is not required, code will still run. Test images are included.
